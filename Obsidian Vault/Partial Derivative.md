Derivative of a function f(x) that inlucudes several variables, BUT the derivative f '() is retalive to only one variable.

regular: f'(x) = (f(x+ hx) - f(x)) / hx
partial:  fx = af/ax = (f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)) / h               *can solve for any variable present in equation


ex)  f(x, y) = 3x + 4y
	fx = af/ax = 3
	fy = af/ay = 4

ex) f(x, y) = x^2 * y + sin x + cos y
	fx= af/ax = 2x * y + cos x + 0 = 2xy+ cos x
	fy = af/ay = x^2 - sin y
