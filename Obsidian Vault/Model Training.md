Train the selected model using the training data. During training, the model learns to map input text to the correct intent. Key steps include:

-   Loss Function: Define a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy) to measure the model's error.
-   Optimization: Use an optimizer (e.g., stochastic gradient descent) to update the model's weights.
-   Backpropagation: Update model weights using backpropagation to minimize the loss.
