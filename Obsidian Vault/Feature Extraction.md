Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical vectors that can be used as input for the model. Common techniques include:

-   Bag of Words (BoW): Represent each document as a vector of word frequencies.
-   TF-IDF: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weights words based on their importance in a document relative to a collection of documents.
-   Word Embeddings: Use pre-trained word vectors (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT embeddings) to represent words and sentences.
-   Tokenization: For deep learning models, tokenize the text into sequences of integers where each integer corresponds to a word or subword.
